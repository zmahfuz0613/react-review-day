# React Review Day

Today is a day for you to reflect on and review the unit. First, take a minute and assess where you're at with React. Do you feel comfortable with the basic fundamentals? Or do you feel like you could apply your knowledge to another activity?

It may be useful to check out Bloom's Taxonomy to self-reflect and assess.

Here are some options for what you could do today.

## If you're still uncomfortable with the fundamentals

* [Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-fundamentals-review) is a review packet with mini-lessons on the React unit. There's also a very scaffolded lab included.

* [Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-tvmaze) is a lab on React with an API.

* [Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-shopping-cart) is another lab on building a shopping cart with React.

* [Here's](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/react-router-lab-stocks) a lab for practicing with React Router.

* You could add Jest tests to previous homeworks and labs to get more practice with testing. You could also find a design on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and re-create the components in Storybook.

* Write [sketch notes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/how-to-get-started-with-sketchnotes/) about our React material. Revisit old lessons to do this.

*Challenge*: Use Hooks for any of these assignments.

## If you are looking for a challenge

* Teach yourself something new within React and then build something with your new skill. Some great options would be [Redux](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/react-redux), [React Native](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-native-intro), [GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoaZnAB9_yk), or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

* Write a blog post on something you learned this unit. Hint: Storybook or styling in React would be a ðŸ”¥ topic. Show the world your knowledge -- it'll be awesome for your career. You could also make a YouTube video teaching a concept.

* Contribute to open source. There are so many libraries out there looking for contributors, and having open source contributions on your portfolio/resume is a huge leg up. Check the `issues` tab of any React project.

## Deliverables

By 10:30 AM, DM the instructional team with a one-paragraph assessment of how you feel about React and a plan for what you will work on today.

If you want to work in a small group, you can. Just let the instructional team know and we can put you in a breakout room together. Otherwise, you can disconnect from Zoom. The instructional team is here to help if you have personalized ideas or get stuck today. Slack us and we'll be there to help!

By 4:00 PM EST, turn in what you've been working on as an issue to this repository. We'll grade it as a homework, so make sure you're working on something.
